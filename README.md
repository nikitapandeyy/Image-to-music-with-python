Image to music through Pixel mapping
Tech Stack: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Collab<br>
◦ : Utilized advanced image processing techniques to convert hues to a NumPy array.<br>
◦ : Applied mathematical mapping functions to translate the array into musical octaves, scales, and frequencies.<br>
◦ : Process resulted in the generation of unique musical compositions using algorithmically generated data.
